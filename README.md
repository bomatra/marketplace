# Please see getting started section on how to run application
# Brief description of your process (approximately 2 paragraphs or so) that includes:
# ■ Your technical decisions - which framework did you choose and why? If you used libraries, how did you choose them?
I chose react because:
1. I am familiar with react 
2. It is easy to build component modular design.
# ■ Any choices you made that were inspired from or deviated from the wireframe and why.
none
# ■ Any questions that you would have liked to ask the design team while working on this.
1. Does this site has to accessibilty enabled. As it is .gov site. Do you make sure all design are accessibilyt enabled?
# Brief spec of how you would implement the following functionality (approximately 2 paragraphs or so):
■ Remove a household member
    I would add checkboxes on each card and a button to remove a houehold member.
    User can check/select all the cards (memebers) delete one or many.
■ Edit a household member
    I would add a modal to input member detail and save button on modal.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
